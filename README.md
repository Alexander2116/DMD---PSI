# DMD---PSI

This is a continuation of MPhys project started in 2021/2022.

The code is built on python=3.8.x on Windows 10. 

The best way to compile the code is to use Visual Studio Code and change the interprater to python=3.8.x. Anaconda's Spyder seems not to work with the changed interpreter (it's maybe only my issue).
