# DMD---PSI

This is a continuation of MPhys project started in 2021/2022.

The code is built on python=3.8.x on Windows 10. 

The best way to compile the code is to use Visual Studio Code and change the interprater to python=3.8.x. Anaconda's Spyder seems not to work with the changed interpreter (it's maybe only my issue).


## How to run
Open new_compressive_sensing.py and run it.
You should see a terminal interface where you can create a new main sequence (not really needed, not tested) and add subsequence (the main bit).
The number of repetition cannot be (yet) specified. Time frame can be set.
